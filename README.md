### **2. Brief Description**  
Welcome to **Overdrive**—a high-octane coding challenge where creativity, technical expertise, and innovation come together!  

In this event, participants will develop **feature-rich applications** by leveraging **RESTful APIs** and **a variety of NPM packages**. The goal is to integrate these tools efficiently to solve complex problems and enhance functionality—whether it's a **dynamic website**, an **intuitive desktop application**, or a **powerful CLI tool**.  

Participants are encouraged to push their creative boundaries, designing solutions that stand out in originality, efficiency, and impact.  

Are you ready to shift into **Overdrive** and redefine what's possible with code?
